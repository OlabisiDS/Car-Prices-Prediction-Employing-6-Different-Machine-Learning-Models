# Car Prices Prediction

Predicting car prices is a challenging yet essential task in the automotive industry. This project explores the application of six diverse machine learning models to predict car prices based on various features.

## Models Used

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Ridge
5. Gradient Boosting
6. XGBoost

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises a comprehensive set of car features, including make, model, year, mileage, and more. The goal is to build models that accurately predict car prices based on these attributes.

# Importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset...

# Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and splitting into training and testing sets...

# Model training and evaluation using various algorithms...

# Visualizing predictions and comparing the performance of each model...

# Enjoy predicting and understanding car prices with this diverse set of machine learning techniques!
